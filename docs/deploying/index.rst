Deploying your site
===================

ICEkit is designed to be easily deployed and scaled using Docker. Use the
Deploy to Docker Cloud button to create a new default ICEkit stack on
`Docker Cloud`_.

   :alt: Deploy to Docker Cloud

(This is mostly for testing and demonstration purposes - you won't be able to
customise your project when deploying the official ICEkit Docker image this way.)

.. TODO: document how to deploy your own project, with or without using Travis.
