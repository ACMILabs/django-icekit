<h1>Code of conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code
applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and
guidance.</p>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take
it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to
enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all public spaces managed by the
Interaction Consortium (IC). This includes chat rooms, the mailing
lists, the issue tracker, IC events, and any other forums created by the
project team which the community uses for communication. In addition,
violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person’s
ability to participate within them.</p>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you
report it by emailing <a class="reference external" href="mailto:labs&#37;&#52;&#48;interaction&#46;net&#46;au">labs<span>&#64;</span>interaction<span>&#46;</span>net<span>&#46;</span>au</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and
supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but
is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national
origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class,
educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and
mental and physical ability.</li>
<li><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you
in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will
affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences
into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide
community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s
primary language.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We
might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot
allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important
to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Django community
should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with
people outside the Django community.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of
professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to
others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and
other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is
not limited to:<ul>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally
identifying information (“doxing”).</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
stop, then stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both
social and technical, happen all the time and Django is no exception.
It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Django
comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of
backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues.
Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming
each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to
resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
