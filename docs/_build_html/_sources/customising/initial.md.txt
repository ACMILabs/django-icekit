## Configure your project

You will need to provide some basic information to configure your project.

You can do so with environment variables, or by editing the `docker-cloud.yml`
and `project_settings.py` files.

All settings are optional, but you can provide:

  * `BASE_SETTINGS_MODULE` tells ICEkit to run in `develop` or `production`
    mode.

  * `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` and `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, so ICEkit can
    send emails (only in `production` mode).

    We recommend [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/), but any SMTP credentials
    will do.

  * `MASTER_PASSWORD` (only in `develop` mode) so you can login as any user
    with the same password.

  * `MEDIA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `MEDIA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and
    `MEDIA_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` so ICEkit can store file uploads
    [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

    The specified bucket should already exist, or the credentials provided
    should have permission to create buckets. This is especially important when
    deploying to ephemeral infrastructure, like Docker Cloud.

  * `PGDATABASE`, `PGHOST`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGPORT` and `PGUSER`, if you need to
    connect to provide credentials for your PostgreSQL database.

    We recommend [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), especially when
    deploying to ephemeral infrastructure, like Docker Cloud.

  * `SENTRY_DSN`, if you want to use [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/) for
    real-time error tracking.

  * `SITE_DOMAIN` and `SITE_NAME`, so ICEkit knows how to generate redirects
    correctly and knows what to call your site.
