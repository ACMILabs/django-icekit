ICEkit's architecture
=====================

ICEkit is a next-generation Python CMS by |the IC|_. It has publishing and
workflow tools for small teams of content professionals, and a powerful content
framework, based on django-fluent_. ICEkit is written in Python, using the
Django framework.

ICEkit is delivered as a Docker-compatible package, which means that it's easy
to share a consistent development environment across your team, or to deploy on
any Docker-compatible web host, including top-tier cloud hosting services like
AWS.

This section documents some of the architectural principles underpinning ICEkit.
