# Deployment

[![Deploy to Docker Cloud](https://files.cloud.docker.com/images/deploy-to-dockercloud.svg)](https://cloud.docker.com/stack/deploy/)

ICEkit is designed to be easily deployed and scaled using Docker. Use the
Deploy to Docker Cloud button above to create a new ICEkit stack on
[Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/).

(You won't be able to customise your project when deploying the official
ICEkit Docker image this way.)
