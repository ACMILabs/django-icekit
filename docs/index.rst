Welcome to ICEkit (and GLAMkit)!
================================

ICEkit is a CMS -- or rather, a toolkit for building CMSes designed for
small teams of content professionals. For an overview, see
:doc:`overview/at-a-glance`.

GLAMkit_ is an extension of ICEkit designed especially for
Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (the GLAM sector) and pretty much
any cultural or collecting institution. For a more extensive overview, see
http://glamkit.com.

This documentation covers the technical usage and API of GLAMkit and ICEkit.
