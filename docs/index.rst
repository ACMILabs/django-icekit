Welcome to GLAMkit+ICEkit!
==========================

ICEkit is a CMS -- or rather, a toolbox for building CMSes -- designed for
small teams of content professionals. For an overview, see
:doc:`intro/at-a-glance`.

GLAMkit_ is a batteries-included *flavour* of ICEkit designed especially for
Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (the GLAM sector) and pretty much
any cultural or collecting institution. For a more extensive overview, see
http://glamkit.com.

This documentation covers the technical usage and API of GLAMkit and ICEkit.
