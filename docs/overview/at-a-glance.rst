GLAMkit at a glance
==================

What is ICEkit?
---------------

The engine that runs GLAMkit is called ICEkit. ICEkit is a toolkit for building
CMSes, designed for any small team of content professionals. For an overview,
see :doc:`overview/at-a-glance`. One day there will be other flavours of ICEkit
for other markets - this anticipated future is why the repository and some
classes are called 'ICEkit'. For now, ICEkit and GLAMkit are much the same
thing, and we prefer using 'GLAMkit'.

Why did we create GLAMkit and ICEkit?
-------------------------------------

Every day, we at IC_ create and host sites for clients with demanding digital
needs. Our clients have large amounts of content to work through and publish.
They usually only have a small team (of busy people) who edit on the site.
They usually have databases and other systems throughout their organisation
that need to integrate with the site. And of course the result needs to look
great and not break the bank.

GLAMkit and ICEkit represent the distillation of our knowledge and experience
in working on technically challenging projects with these clients, and with
museum clients in particular. Out of the box, it has everything that small teams
of content professionals need to get started creating and publishing pages of
content.

We love building sites in Python/Django, and it's a great framework to solve
demanding digital challenges. But we couldn't find a Python CMS with the
enterprise-level workflow and publishing features that our clients need.

So we made one -- and here it is.

More than that, ICEkit also includes our knowledge about how to deploy and
scale. That's why it can be installed and deployed as a scalable Docker image,
which can be installed on any top-tier cloud host.
