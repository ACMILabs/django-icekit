GLAMkit at a glance
==================

What is ICEkit?
---------------

The engine that runs GLAMkit is called ICEkit. ICEkit is a toolkit for building
CMSes, designed for teams of content professionals. One day there will
be other flavours of ICEkit for other markets - this anticipated future is why
the repository and some classes are named `ICEkit`. For now, you can treat
ICEkit and GLAMkit as interchangeable.

Why did we create GLAMkit?
--------------------------

Every day, we at IC_ create and host sites for clients with demanding digital
needs. Our clients have large amounts of content to work through and publish.
They usually only have a small team (of busy people) who edit on the site.
They usually have databases and other systems throughout their organisation
that need to integrate with the site. And of course the result needs to look
great and not break the bank.

GLAMkit represents the distillation of our knowledge and experience
in working on technically challenging projects with these clients, and with
museum clients in particular. Out of the box, it has everything that teams
of content professionals need to get started creating and publishing pages of
content.

We love building sites in Python/Django, and it's a great framework to solve
demanding digital challenges. But we couldn't find a Python CMS with the
enterprise-level workflow and publishing features that our clients need.

So we made one -- and here it is.

More than just the software, GLAMkit also includes our knowledge about how to
deploy and scale. That's why it can be installed and deployed as a scalable
Docker image, which can be installed on any Docker-compatible host, including
the top-tier ones.
