# Dockerfile installs into the icekit docker image.

# NB: IF YOU CHANGE THE REVISION, CHANGE IT IN THE PROJECT'S Dockerfile AS WELL!
# In installed projects, this may end up as -e git+https://github.com/ic-labs/django-icekit@{COMMIT}#egg=django-icekit[api,dev,django18,forms,glamkit,project,search,test]
-e ..[api,brightcove,dev,django18,forms,glamkit,project,search,test]
