# requirements-icekit.txt is used by go.sh to install whatever the icekit
# Dockerfile installs into the icekit docker image.

# it should pin icekit to the same version or commit mentioned at the top of
# `Dockerfile`:

-e ..[api,brightcove,dev,django18,docs,forms,glamkit,project,search,test]

# and any dependencies that django-icekit has in its requirements.txt
